# [Josephus Problem](https://github.com/BhargavSai-Lingampalli/Josephus-Problem/blob/main/JosephusProblem.c)
In computer science and mathematics, the **Josephus Problem** (or **Josephus permutation**) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.
## The Rules
A number of people are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a starting point in the circle and proceeds around the circle. After a specified number of people are killed, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and killing the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.

The problem—given the number of people,and number to be killed—is to choose the position in the initial circle to avoid execution.
### Note
- some rules are simplified and modified by me.
- The original game may looks different.
